# 🖼️ Game Assets - Images

This folder contains all the image assets used in the **Space Invaders** game.

### 📂 Contents

- `Game_Icon.png` – Icon displayed in the game window and title bar  
- `player.png` – Sprite for the player's spaceship  
- `enemy.png` – Sprite for alien enemies  
- `background.jpg` – Background image for the game screen  
- `bullet.png` – Image for bullets fired by the player

### 📌 Notes

- All images should be in `.png` or `.jpg` format for compatibility with Pygame.
- Recommended resolution: keep sprites small and lightweight (e.g., 32x32 or 64x64 px).
- You can replace these with your own custom assets as long as filenames are consistent with the code.


> Make sure all image paths in the game script (`space_invaders.py`) correctly match the file names and folder structure.
